# given an array of integers, find product of the element
# ex arr = [4,5,1,8] output [40, 32, 160, 20]
# inialize a new array with length of input arr and fill ele 1
# calculate the left and product and add in that ele index arr[1] = 5,
# for the left_product is 4 and right product is 8, multiple both and put it in [1,32,1,1]
# required 2 for loop to solve this problem
